# FortWeapons

This was not created to contain every Fortnite items.

Explanations:

* Exotics are mainly located at [15.50](battle-royale-items/15.50-items.md) items, but newer ones are located in their respective pages.
* Display Name color is the item rarity, if its black or white, its uncommon or I don't know.
* UC = Uncommon, <mark style="color:green;">C = Common</mark>, <mark style="color:blue;">R = Rare</mark>, <mark style="color:purple;">VR = Epic</mark>, <mark style="color:orange;">SR = Legendary</mark>, <mark style="color:yellow;">UR = Mythic</mark>.
* I know I group them a lot like 20.00 to 25.00 but I wont download every versions.
* Exotic weapons display names, in tables, are <mark style="color:red;">red</mark>, because there is no other color, and exotic were the transcendent rarity.
